This is fine when we're using a battery or DC power supply, but often we'll have situations where the value changes quickly or steadily over time and we want to keep track of those changing values. An oscilloscope displays a record (or trace) of the measured voltage difference over time. The display shows a graph of the measured voltage difference on the vertical axis (or y-axis) and time on the horizontal axis (or x-axis).\n",

We can either set up the oscilloscope to constantly display measurements in real time or we can ask it to display a set of measurements that pass some criteria (called *triggering*). For this lab, we'll want to set up the oscilloscope to *trigger* (i.e., collect data) when the voltage difference changes suddenly past some threshold (called a *trigger level*).\n",
